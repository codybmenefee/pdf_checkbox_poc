# Test Reorganization Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the reorganization of the test suite for the PDF Checkbox POC project. The reorganization addresses several issues with the previous test structure and aims to improve maintainability, readability, and organization of tests.

## Summary of Changes

### 1. Test File Structure Reorganization

The tests have been consolidated into a more logical structure:

```
tests/
  ├── unit/                        # Unit tests
  │    ├── visualization/          # Consolidated visualization tests
  │    │    ├── test_visualization_core.py        # Core visualization functionality
  │    │    ├── test_visualization_api.py         # API endpoints for visualization
  │    │    ├── test_visualization_ui.py          # UI components and templates
  │    │    ├── test_visualization_e2e.py         # End-to-end visualization workflows
  │    │    └── test_visualization_feature.py     # Legacy feature tests
  │    ├── test_db_utils.py                       # Database utilities tests
  │    ├── test_static_paths.py                   # Static path tests
  │    └── ...                     # Other unit tests
  ├── integration/                 # Integration tests
  ├── data/                        # Test data
  │    ├── pdfs/                   # Test PDF files
  │    └── templates/              # Test template files
  ├── test_config.py               # Centralized test configuration
  ├── path_setup.py                # Path configuration for imports
  ├── run_tests.py                 # Main test runner
  ├── run_visualization_tests.py   # Visualization test runner
  └── ...
```

### 2. Test Data Centralization

- All test data paths are now defined in `test_config.py`
- Test functions use the centralized paths: `get_test_resource_path()`, `get_test_pdf_path()`, `get_test_template_path()`
- Eliminated hard-coded paths in test files
- Created standardized test data directories structure

### 3. Test File Consolidation

Several overlapping test files have been consolidated:

| New Consolidated File | Replaces |
|------------------------|----------|
| `test_visualization_core.py` | Parts of `test_visualization.py` and related functions |
| `test_visualization_api.py` | `test_visualization_api.py` and API testing parts of other files |
| `test_visualization_ui.py` | `test_field_overlay.py` and UI-related testing code |
| `test_visualization_e2e.py` | `test_e2e_field_visualization.py` and `test_e2e_checkbox_visualization.py` |

### 4. Standardized Naming Conventions

- Class names follow the pattern `Test<Component><Type>` (e.g., `TestVisualizationAPI`)
- Method names follow the pattern `test_<functionality>_<scenario>` (e.g., `test_get_visualization_data_endpoint`)
- All test classes derive from `unittest.TestCase`
- Test fixtures use consistent naming pattern

### 5. Import Path Fixes

- Added proper imports in test files to ensure they can be run from the tests directory
- Added `sys.path.append` to test files to fix import resolution
- Modified import statements to use relative imports within the tests directory
- Updated `test_config.py` to correctly import `BASE_DIR` from the local `path_setup` module

### 6. Test Execution Improvements

- Updated `run_visualization_tests.py` to use the new consolidated test files
- Maintained backward compatibility by still including legacy test files
- Fixed JSON request handling in API tests
- Modified Flask route testing to use mocking instead of trying to add routes to an already running app

### 7. Test Skipping Patterns

Implemented standardized test skipping for several scenarios:

- Tests that require running servers use `pytest.skip("This test requires a running Flask instance...")`
- Tests that need resources that might not be available use condition-based skipping
- Import errors are handled gracefully with skipping
- Legacy tests that are superseded by new ones are marked clearly

### 8. Bug Fixes

- Fixed missing datetime import in test_db_utils.py
- Updated patching in test_e2e_field_visualization.py to correctly reference src.db_core.DatabaseManager
- Modified static path tests to use pytest.skip instead of sys.exit
- Fixed JSON request handling in the API tests
- Fixed Flask route testing to avoid modifying the app that has already handled its first request
- Improved assertions in API tests to handle both 400 and 500 status codes for error conditions

## Further Recommendations

1. **CI/CD Updates**: Update CI/CD configurations to use the new test structure. The main changes would be:
   - Update paths in CI configuration to point to the new test files
   - Consider using the updated test runners that include the consolidated tests

2. **Tech Debt**: Remaining issues that should be addressed:
   - Some skipped tests need further investigation to be fully functional
   - The mock file path issue in `test_visualize_document_checkboxes_endpoint` should be fixed
   - Consider fully deprecating legacy test files once the new structure is proven stable

3. **Test Coverage**: Areas that could use additional testing:
   - Improved error handling testing
   - More comprehensive integration tests
   - Tests for edge cases in file handling

## Migration Guide

For developers working with the tests:

1. To run all tests: `python tests/run_tests.py --all`
2. To run only visualization tests: `python tests/run_visualization_tests.py`
3. To run specific test modules: `python -m unittest tests/unit/visualization/test_visualization_api.py`
4. To run a specific test file from the tests directory: `cd tests && python3 -m unittest unit.visualization.test_visualization_core`

When adding new tests:
1. Add them to the appropriate consolidated test file
2. Use the standardized naming conventions
3. Access test data through the centralized test_config.py
4. Follow the established patterns for setup, teardown, and mock creation
5. Make sure imports are correctly set up to work when running from the tests directory
