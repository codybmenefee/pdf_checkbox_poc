# Agent Requested Rules

These rules apply only when explicitly requested.

## Suggest Alternative Approaches
- Provide multiple ways to solve a problem, with trade-offs.

## Optimize for Learning
- Explain technical decisions in **clear, concise terms**.

## Review & Improve Existing Code
- Identify areas for **refactoring** or **improvement** without assuming changes are needed.

## Provide a First Draft Before Finalizing
- For complex work, generate a **draft version** before completing the full implementation.
