# Always Rules

These rules apply to every task, no exceptions.

## Stay Focused on the Task
- Work **only** on the specific task at hand; do not go out of scope.

## Preserve Established Patterns
- Do not modify workflows, structures, or conventions unless absolutely necessary.

## Avoid Duplication
- Before writing new code, check for existing functions that accomplish the same goal.
- Identify and clean up redundant or duplicate code.

## Enforce Code Cleanliness
- Refactor bloated files and avoid functions longer than **300 lines**.
- Ensure modularity for maintainability.

## Commit & Document Work Often
- Make **incremental commits** with clear, structured commit messages.
- Keep local files organized to track project progress.

## Keep Solutions Simple
- Avoid over-engineering; prioritize clarity and efficiency.
