# Git & Repository Management Rules

## Every Project Must Have a GitHub Repository
- If no repository exists, create a **new public GitHub repo**.
- Store repository details in a **standardized location** for reference.

## Commit Often with Detailed Notes
- Use structured commit messages:
  - **Feature Addition:** `feat: Added [feature]`
  - **Bug Fix:** `fix: Resolved [issue]`
  - **Refactor:** `refactor: Improved [module]`

## Automate Repository Setup
- Initialize Git (`git init`) if needed.
- Add a **`.gitignore`** file.
- Push an initial commit with a **`README.md`**.

## Branching Best Practices
- Use **feature branches** for new work.
- Merge via **pull requests** (PRs), not direct commits.
