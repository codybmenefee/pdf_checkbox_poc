# Build Planning Rules

These rules ensure agents create structured project plans.

## Map Out a Build Plan
- Before coding, generate a **clear build plan** outlining:
  - Features to be developed.
  - Dependencies and integrations.
  - Expected output.

## Store and Catalog Plans
- Plans should be **saved locally** and easily accessible by agents.
- Completed plans should be cataloged for reference.

## Break Plans Into Daily Goals
- Tasks should be **divided into actionable goals**.
- Reference previous work to ensure continuity.
