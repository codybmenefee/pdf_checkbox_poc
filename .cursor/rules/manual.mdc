# Manual Rules

These rules apply when manually activated.

## Refactoring & Optimization
- Break down large functions into **smaller, reusable modules**.
- Apply **performance improvements** only when requested.

## Deep Code Review & Debugging
- Conduct **in-depth reviews** beyond automated linting.
- Debug tricky issues with **additional logging and tracing**.

## Custom Implementations
- Write specialized solutions only **when standard approaches won't work**.
