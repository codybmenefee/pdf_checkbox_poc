# Context Passing Rules

Ensures smooth transitions between agents due to tool limitations.

## Efficiently Pass Context
- After **25 tool calls**, wrap up and generate a **handoff prompt**.
- Store key progress details in an **accessible location**.

## Automate Context Retention
- Use an **indexing system** to allow agents to search previous work.
- Prioritize **important decisions** in context notes.

## Standardize Handoff Prompts
- Clearly state what has been completed and **next steps** for the next agent.
- Include **relevant files, APIs, or database updates**.
