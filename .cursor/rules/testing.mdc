# Testing Rules

These rules ensure every task is validated with proper testing.

## Plan Testing Before Development
- Define **unit tests** and **end-to-end tests** before coding.
- Identify edge cases, failure scenarios, and performance limits.

## Execute Tests to Prove Work is Complete
- Run all relevant tests before submitting a task.
- Ensure no regressions or breakages.

## Unit Testing Best Practices
- Cover core logic and edge cases.
- Use the right frameworks:
  - **Flask/Python:** `pytest`
  - **LWC:** Jest
  - **React Native:** React Testing Library + Jest

## End-to-End Testing Guidelines
- Test complete workflows for real-world validation.
- Automate tests using **Selenium, Cypress, or Playwright**.

## Maintain Test Quality
- Prioritize meaningful test cases over sheer quantity.
- Add new test cases for any discovered bugs.
