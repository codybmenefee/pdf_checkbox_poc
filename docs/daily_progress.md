# Daily Progress: Static File Path Resolution

## Summary

Today we fixed the issue with static file handling in the PDF Checkbox POC application. The main problem was that the `/api/visualizations/` route wasn't working properly in the tests, returning a 404 error even though the corresponding static files existed.

## Key Findings

1. **Route Conflict**: The main issue was a route conflict between the main app and the UI API blueprint. Both defined the same route pattern (`/api/visualizations/<visualization_id>/<path:filename>`), and the blueprint's route was taking precedence.

2. **Testing Improvements**: We added test routes and debug output to verify route registration and troubleshoot the issue.

3. **Documentation**: We created comprehensive documentation about the static file handling to make future maintenance easier.

## Changes Made

1. **Fix Route Conflict**:
   - Renamed the UI API blueprint route to `/api/ui_visualizations/<visualization_id>/<path:filename>`
   - Added debug output to the Flask app to show registered routes
   - Added test functionality to verify routes are registered correctly

2. **Documentation**:
   - Created a detailed static file configuration guide
   - Updated the README with static file information
   - Added a commit plan to track progress

3. **Testing**:
   - Updated test runners to include static file tests
   - Fixed the failing test by resolving the route conflict

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Additional Tests**: There are still some untracked test files that could be added to the repository.

2. **Performance Optimization**: The tests show ResourceWarnings about unclosed file handles, which could be addressed in future work.

3. **Deployment**: Follow the deployment plan outlined in the commit plan document.
