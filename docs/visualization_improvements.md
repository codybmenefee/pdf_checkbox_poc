# Field Visualization Improvements

## Overview
This document outlines the improvements made to the PDF field visualization feature, focusing on fixing issues related to form data retrieval, image loading, and adding new capabilities for better user experience and monitoring.

## Fixed Issues

### 1. Form Data Retrieval
- Modified the form data retrieval in `ui_api.py` to use the `FilledFormModel` directly with proper initialization
- Fixed issues that were causing data retrieval differences between test forms and NCAF-8 forms
- Added better error reporting for form data fetching

### 2. Image Loading
- Implemented robust image loading with multiple fallback mechanisms:
  - Primary URL: `/static/visualizations/{id}/{filename}`
  - Direct file path: `/{id}/{filename}`
  - API path: `/api/visualizations/{id}/{filename}`
- Created a new route in `app.py` that serves visualization files from multiple potential locations:
  - Default static folder
  - Project root static folder
  - Upload folder
  - Direct ID as path

### 3. Client-side Error Handling
- Enhanced the client-side JavaScript to handle image loading failures gracefully
- Added fallback to placeholder image if all loading attempts fail
- Improved error logging and reporting

## New Features

### 1. Image Preloading
- Implemented preloading of adjacent pages for faster navigation:
  - When a page is loaded, the next page is preloaded automatically
  - Previous page is also preloaded if available
  - Uses a caching mechanism to avoid redundant loading
  - Sequential preloading to prevent overwhelming the browser

### 2. Performance Metrics
- Added comprehensive metrics tracking for monitoring performance:
  - Image loading success rates and timing
  - Page navigation tracking
  - Error reporting
  - Session statistics
- Server-side API endpoints for recording metrics:
  - `/api/metrics/log` for individual events
  - `/api/metrics/report` for aggregated performance reports
- Metrics storage in both raw (JSONL) and summary (CSV) formats

### 3. Testing Improvements
- Added end-to-end testing for field visualization with `test_e2e_field_visualization.py`
- Created a test script (`test_visualization_forms.sh`) that:
  - Tests both test forms and NCAF-8 forms
  - Verifies API functionality
  - Checks UI loading
  - Runs performance tests
  - Validates metrics collection
- Updated test runner to include the new test cases

## Remaining Considerations

### MongoDB Connectivity
- The MongoDB connection appears intermittent - this could be investigated further
- Added more robust error handling around database operations
- Consider implementing connection pooling or retry mechanisms

### Edge Cases
- Large documents with many pages may still have performance issues
- Different image formats might need additional handling
- Complex field structures could benefit from additional validation

### Future Enhancements
- Add caching headers to improve browser caching of visualization assets
- Implement progressive loading for large documents
- Consider WebSocket notifications for long-running visualization generations
- Add user preference storage for visualization settings
