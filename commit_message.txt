chore: reorganize project structure

- Move Python scripts to tools/ directory
- Move shell scripts to scripts/ directory
- Move documentation files to docs/ directory
- Move GitHub templates to .github/ directory
- Create logs/ directory for log files
- Update README.md to reflect new organization
- Update scripts to reference correct file paths

This change improves project organization and maintainability while reducing clutter in the root directory.
