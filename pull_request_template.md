# Fix Static File Path Resolution

## Problem

The static file handling in the application had several issues:
1. Visualization files were not being properly served through the API route (`/api/visualizations/...`)
2. Tests were failing with 404 errors when trying to access static files via the API
3. Documentation about static file handling was lacking

## Solution

### Route Conflict Resolution

The main issue was a route conflict between the main app and the UI API blueprint, where both defined the same route pattern (`/api/visualizations/<visualization_id>/<path:filename>`). I resolved this by:

1. Renaming the UI API blueprint route to `/api/ui_visualizations/<visualization_id>/<path:filename>`
2. Adding diagnostic routes and logging to verify route registration
3. Updating tests to validate correct route handling

### Documentation Improvements

1. Created detailed static file configuration documentation (docs/static_file_configuration.md)
2. Updated README with static file information
3. Added comprehensive commit plan and daily progress report

### Testing Enhancements

1. Updated test runners to include static file tests
2. Fixed failing tests by resolving the route conflict

## Testing

1. All tests now pass, including the previously failing `/api/visualizations/` route test
2. Manual verification that static files are properly served
3. Debug routes confirm correct route registration

## Changes

The following commits were made:
- `0204470` docs: Update README with static file information  
- `f070902` test: Update test runners to include static file tests  
- `0e7aa2f` docs: Add static file configuration documentation  
- `5b373df` docs: Add commit plan for static file path resolution  
- `6db2331` fix: Resolve route conflict for visualization files

## Next Steps

1. Deploy the changes as outlined in the commit plan
2. Address ResourceWarnings about unclosed file handles in future work
3. Consider adding the remaining untracked test files to the repository
